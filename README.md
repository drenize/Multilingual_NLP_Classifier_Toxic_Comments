# INTERNET RULE #1: Never read the comments.

How is it possible that the very democratic element of the internet - the comment section - has been turned into a tool of cruelty by so called *trolls*?

# Objective 

The goal of this project is to build a natural language model that classifies text input (social media comments) into toxic and non-toxic catetegories in multiple languages.

# Methods
In order to achieve this, I decided to go with pretrained RNN models like [DistilBERT](https://huggingface.co/distilbert-base-multilingual-cased) and [LASER](https://research.fb.com/downloads/laser-language-agnostic-sentence-representations/), which include a variety of languages.

# Data

Google and Jugsaw provided the dataset for a kaggle competition. The data can be downloaded [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-multilingual-toxic-comment-classification/overview).
