# INTERNET RULE #1: Never read the comments.

How is it possiblethat the very democratic element of the internet - the comment section - has been turned into a tool of cruelty by so called *trolls*?

# Objective 

The goal of this project is to build a natural language model that classifies text input (social media comments) into toxic and non-toxic catetegories in multiple languages.

# Methods
In order to achieve this, I decided to go with pretrained RNN models like BERT and LASER, which include a variety of languages.
